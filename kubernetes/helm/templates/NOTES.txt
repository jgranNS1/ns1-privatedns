The bootstrap process was executed -
if the installation was successful, there should be a configmap called
ns1-bootstrap that contains operator and initial user credentials.
If this configmap is not present or is incomplete, please check the logs on the
bootstrap pod.
The job that bootstrapped the deployment can be deleted if it was successful.
